## What would the Earth and Mars look like (to an astronomer) if they cannibalized their rings to form moons? 
## Could under-dense super-Earths and sub-Neptunes actually be ringed rocky exoplanets?

### Background/Significance
Over the course of its lifetime, the Kepler mission identified over 3,500 exoplanets using the transit method, many of which fall into the size categories of super-Earth or sub-Neptune (Batalha, 2014). Some of these planets, for example, TrES-4, HD 209458b, HAT-P-1b, and WASP-1b, have anomalously low measured densities (Mandushev et al., 2007). In addition, an unexpectedly large inferred radius may lead to the misclassification of a planetary candidate as a false-positive (Zuluaga et al., 2015). Much of the work looking at potential exoplanetary ring systems has focused on larger planets, but in principle it is possible to have rings around smaller rocky planets as well (Hesselbrock & Minton, 2017). This work assesses the extent at which a ring system caused by the in-spiraling of a satellite could affect the observed density of a rocky planet. I use the physical characteristics of the Mars-Phobos and Earth-moon systems to model ring creation and simulate the effect of rings on rocky exoplanet measurements.

### Results

For the Earth-moon system, the density for a thick ring can be as low as 280 kg/m^3^, compared to the Earth’s actual density of 5510 kg/m^3^. In the thick ring scenario, the inferred density will still be less than half of Earth’s actual density for inclinations as high as 80°. Even for the thin ring scenario, where inner ring radius is 90% of the outer ring radius, the inferred density is less than half of the actual density for inclinations up to 65°. At moderate inclinations, the inferred density is similar to the density of Neptune, 1638 kg/m^3^, which indicates the potential for ringed Earth- sized rocky planets to appear to have sub-Neptune characteristics.

Mars has a lower density than Earth, 3933 kg/m^3^, so the inferred density of the ringed Mars scenarios is even lower than the ringed Earth scenarios. For the thick ringed Mars, the density is as low as 160 kg/m^3^ for a face-on orientation, and for a medium or thick ring the density is comparable to or less than Neptune density for inclination angles less than 80°. Both the Mars-Phobos and Earth-moon ring systems can produce densities consistent with previously discovered low-density exoplanets (e.g. Kepler-11d, Batalha 2014; TrES-4, Mandushev et al. 2007; HD 209458b, Knutson et al. 2007).

For a transiting exoplanet, the transit depth depends on the inferred area, and therefore radius of the planet. For both systems, the inferred radius can be up to almost 3 times the actual radius of the planet. For a constant stellar area, the transit depth will increase with the square of the projected area. This shows that over a large range of inclinations, the presence of rings could potentially more than double the transit depths for exoplanet observations.

I find that a ring system can have varying thickness and orientation and still have a significant impact on the observed transit, and therefore the inferred radius and density of the exoplanet. The addition of a ringed system can be enough to make a rocky planet appear to have the density of an icy gas planet, or even make it appear to have an unphysically low density. This increases the likelihood that some of the low-density exoplanets and candidates labeled ‘false- positives’ because of an anomalously large radius to mass relationship could actually be ringed rocky exoplanets. The ‘false-positives’ would be more likely to have low inclinations and thicker ring systems because those characteristics produce more extreme low densities.  

Future work is needed to determine how to verify the existence of ring systems. Because they are so thin, they would likely have very small photometric and spectroscopic signatures, so their signals would be difficult to identify from current data. In addition, since many of the super-Earth and sub-Neptunes found by Kepler were close to their parent star, it may be important to model the stability of rocky rings close to a star, which may constrain the possible locations of such ringed rocky planets.
